Thoughts:
I have already attempted to add the `echo` command to the 'hello.sh' script in order to print 'hello' without asking for confirmation. However, it seems that the changes were not successfully made. I will need to use the `edit` command to add the `echo` command to the script again.

Action:
```
edit 0 -1 "echo 'hello'"
```
